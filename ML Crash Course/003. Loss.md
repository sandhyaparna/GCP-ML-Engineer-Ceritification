* Model starts with random weights --> loss is computed & gradient of loss helps in --> parameter updation --> again calculate loss --> repeat till loss no longer changes/decreases --> implies model has converged
* very low learning rate requires a lot of epochs for conversion
* Loss can be decreased by efficiently choosing the direction to update parameters
* Gradient is a vector with magnitude & direction
* If learning rate is large, take big steps (step size = learning rate * gradient)
* If learning rate is small, takes small step size
* In case of non-convex optimization problems, where there are many local minima, weights initiation matters


### Optimization algorithms
* Stochastic Gradient Descent: 1 example at a time
* Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Weights are updates a fter a batch of examples


Training a model simply means learning (determining) good values for all the weights and the bias from labeled examples. In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss; this process is called **empirical risk minimization**
