### Types of ML problems
* Classification - Binary, Multi-class, Multi-label
* Regression
* Clustering
* Association rule learning or Recommendation engines
* NLP - Entity extraction, NLU, generation, seq-to-seq learning
* Search result ranking

### Define a ML problem & propose a solution
* Articulate your problem - What are you trying to solve, how is it helping end-user?, What problem is my product facing?, Would it be a good problem for ML?
* See if any labeled data exits - supervised or unsupervised
* Design your data for the model - construct data set
* Determine where data comes from
* Determine easily obtained inputs
* Determine quantifiable outputs - Online & offline metrics

### Identify Good problems for ML
* Clear Use Case - What problem is my product facing?, Would it be a good problem for ML?
* Know the Problem Before Focusing on the Data - list some potential solutions to test in order to generate the best model
* Lean on Your Team's Logs - Data might not be collected for your specific task but understand how can it be useful
* Predictive Power - Always make sur ethat you are using relevant features in the model and not using all the features that are available
* Predictions vs. Decisions - ML is better at making decisions than giving you insights
  * What video the learner wants to watch next.	Show those videos in the recommendation bar.
  * Probability someone will click on a search result.	If P(click) > 0.12, prefetch the web page.
  * What fraction of a video ad the user will watch.	If a small fraction, don't show the user the ad.
  
### ML Process
1. Set the research goal - I want to predict how heavy traffic will be on a given day.
2. Make a hypothesis -	I think the weather forecast is an informative signal.
3. Collect the data -	Collect historical traffic data and weather on each day.
4. Test your hypothesis -	Train a model using this data.
5. Analyze your results -	Is this model better than existing systems?
6. Reach a conclusion -	I should (not) use this model to make predictions, because of X, Y, and Z.
7. Refine hypothesis and repeat -	Time of year could be a helpful signal.

### Hard ML problems
* Clustering - What does each cluster mean in an unsupervised learning problem? You can try to assign a meaning to a cluster, but this can be tricky because the model might not group by criteria that you find intuitive. One alternative approach is to label some items before you cluster, and then try to propagate those labels across the entire cluster. For instance, if all items with label X end up in one cluster, maybe you can spread label X to other examples.
* Anomaly Detection - The trick is, how do you decide what constitutes an anomaly to get labeled data? One option is to define a heuristic and use it to label anomalies. 
* Causation -  it is easy to see that something happened, but much harder to understand why it happened. Did consumers buy a particular book because they saw a positive review the week before, or would they have bought it even without that review?
* No Existing Data - Without data, use a simple, heuristic, rule-based system. Many new products with no training data start with a heuristic rule system, and obtain training data only after users interact with it. Once you have training data, try to find patterns in it. If there are no patterns or only trivial patterns, then machine learning probably will not provide value. If there are many patterns and it is important to make accurate predictions, then using machine learning might be the right approach.

# Use Cases

* Data: conversation data - Tech Support corpus
* Challenges: Quality of response, when providing suggestions, all top 3 suggestions should NOT be highly correlated, meaning diverse suggestions (cluster outputs and choose top 1 from each cluster), latency (run a model in order to decide if we have want to give suggestions or not - similar to markdown model) , privacy
* Stochastic Gradient Descent with AdaGrad, gradient clipping, normalization
