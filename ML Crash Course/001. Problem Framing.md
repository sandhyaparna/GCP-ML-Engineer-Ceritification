### Types of ML problems
* Classification - Binary, Multi-class, Multi-label
* Regression
* Clustering
* Association rule learning or Recommendation engines
* NLP - Entity extraction, NLU, generation, seq-to-seq learning
* Search result ranking

### Define a ML problem & propose a solution
* Articulate your problem - What are you trying to solve, how is it helping end-user ?
* See if any labeled data exits - supervised or unsupervised
* Design your data for the model - construct data set
* Determine where data comes from
* Determine easily obtained inputs
* Determine quantifiable outputs - Online & offline metrics

### ML Process
1. Set the research goal - I want to predict how heavy traffic will be on a given day.
2. Make a hypothesis -	I think the weather forecast is an informative signal.
3. Collect the data -	Collect historical traffic data and weather on each day.
4. Test your hypothesis -	Train a model using this data.
5. Analyze your results -	Is this model better than existing systems?
6. Reach a conclusion -	I should (not) use this model to make predictions, because of X, Y, and Z.
7. Refine hypothesis and repeat -	Time of year could be a helpful signal.

* Data: conversation data - Tech Support corpus
* Challenges: Quality of response, when providing suggestions, all top 3 suggestions should NOT be highly correlated, meaning diverse suggestions (cluster outputs and choose top 1 from each cluster), latency (run a model in order to decide if we have want to give suggestions or not - similar to markdown model) , privacy
* Stochastic Gradient Descent with AdaGrad, gradient clipping, normalization
